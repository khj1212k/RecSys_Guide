# Graph-based Models

Models the relationship between users and items as a **Bipartite Graph**. Utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to propagate information not only from direct neighbors but also from "neighbors of neighbors" (High-order Connectivity) to learn embeddings.

## Types

### 1. [NGCF (Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering)](./01_NGCF.md)

- Applies GCN (Graph Convolutional Networks) to recommender systems, introducing the concept of Embedding Propagation.

### 2. [LightGCN](./02_LightGCN.md)

- A model that drastically improved performance and speed by removing unnecessary non-linear activation functions and transformation matrices from NGCF. It is currently the standard for graph-based recommendation.
